In May, [Rosario Gennaro](/authors/rosario-gennaro) was named a 2020 Fellow of the [International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)](https://iacr.org/). IACR established its [Fellows Program](https://iacr.org/fellows/) in 2002 to recognize oustanding members for significant technical and professional contributions to cryptology and related fields. This is a distinguished honor, as the number of IACR members chosen as Fellows is less than 0.5% each year.

Rosario is Professor of Computer Science at the [City University of New York (CUNY)](https://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~rosario/) and serves as a Research Advisor to Protocol Labs. His IACR Fellowship specifically recognizes his contributions in the areas of threshold cryptography, delegated computation, and lower bounds. A full list of his publications can be found [here](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/g/Gennaro:Rosario.html).
