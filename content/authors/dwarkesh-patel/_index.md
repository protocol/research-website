Dwarkesh is a computer science major at UT Austin. He loves learning about economics and philosophy, and hosts a podcast where he interviews well-known intellectuals called [The Lunar Society](https://www.youtube.com/c/DwarkeshPatel). Dwarkesh is interested in distributed systems because they are technically fascinating and because they have the potential to improve how we are able to store and communicate data.
