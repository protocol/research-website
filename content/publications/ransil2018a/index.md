This first report focuses on the mechanisms by which electricity is priced in today’s
power markets. Existing energy markets govern the infrastructure that any widely-used
trading protocol must interface with in the short and medium terms. They also suggest
the operational requirements that a protocol must satisfy in the long-term, if it is to
eventually replace existing systems or become a ubiquitous platform upon which future
wholesale markets are built.
